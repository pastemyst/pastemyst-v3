# Libraries

Here are some unofficial API libraries that are developed by other people. They are not directly supported by me (but I do help sometimes). Huge thanks to the developers!

If you are working on a library and need help feel free to contact me. I will also add your library to this list.

Prefer using libraries that support the V3 API - even though there are no libraries currently that support V3.
