# Privacy Policy

**Last updateda**: 20. August 2025.

This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights. By using pastemyst (“the Service”), you agree to this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We only collect information necessary to provide the Service.

### a) Accounts

If you choose to sign in using GitHub or GitLab, we collect and store:

- Your username
- OAuth provider name (GitHub/GitLab)
- OAuth provider ID (your unique ID on GitHub/GitLab)
- Optional profile information such as avatar and user settings

### b) Anonymous Use

If you use the Service without an account, we do not collect any personal information. Your pastes are stored anonymously.

### c) Logs

Our hosting provider (Hetzner) and web server (nginx) may automatically log requests, which can include IP addresses and user agents. These logs are stored temporarily for security and operational purposes only.

### d) Analytics

We use a self-hosted instance of [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), which is privacy-friendly and does not collect personal data, set cookies, or use tracking.

## 2. Cookies

We use only essential cookies:

- Session cookies for login
- Preference cookies for user settings
- We do not use tracking or advertising cookies.

## 3. How We Use Data

We use collected information to:

- Provide and maintain the Service
- Allow account login via GitHub/GitLab
- Store your pastes and settings
- Ensure security and prevent abuse

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

## 4. Data Retention

- Account data is stored until you delete your account.
- Pastes remain until you delete them (or until they expire, if you set an expiration).
- Logs are automatically rotated and deleted after a short period (usually days or weeks).

## 5. Your Rights

We believe privacy and control over your data should apply to everyone.

All users of the Service have the following rights:
